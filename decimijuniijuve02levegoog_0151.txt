iuvenalia this Satire, indulges his honest indignation against
Crispinus and his employer Domitian.

Aller describin some of the enormous crimes of Crispinus, the
poet makes a sudden transition to his extravagcnce and gluttony,

and thereby takes occasion to describe a ridiculons consultation,
held by Domitian over a turbon which was too large to be con-
tained in any dish, that could be found. Alter a long delibera-

tion among the senators, it was proposed, that the fish should be ¹

cut in pisces and thus coolred 3 but at last the opinion of the sen-
ator Montanus prevailed, that it should be dressed whole, and that
s dish, large enough to contain it, should be made expressly for
the purpose of receiving it.

The council is then dismissed, and the Satire concludes with a
rnost severe censure on the emperor’s cruelty and injustice to-
wards some ol the best and most worthy of the Romans.
